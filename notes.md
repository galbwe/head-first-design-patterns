# Head First Design Patterns

## Ch1: Introduction

- The most important factor to account for in sotware engineering is change.
    - The client or stakeholders can decide they want the software to be different or that a new feature is required at any time.
    - Enterprise tools and libraries that you rely on might change.

- Most design patterns are based off of a common principle:
    - Encapsulate the part of a program that is going to change.
    - Ex: Strategy pattern: encapsulates behavior into a class and uses composition so that other classes have that behavior.

- Program to an abstraction: declare the most common base type so that different subclasses can be easily exchanged.
